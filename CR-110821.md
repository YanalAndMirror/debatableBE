## General comments

I'm flying a bit blind here because I haven't used `apollo-server-express` before.
Straight off the bat, I can see you running into some issues as you add more models, resolvers and expand your schema.
Having a single `resolvers.js` and `typeDefs.js` will quickly get out of hand.
My recommended structure would be this one: https://github.com/daniele-zurico/graphql-setup/tree/graph2
